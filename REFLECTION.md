## Reflections:
1. What was the most helpful aspect of this code’s structure?
// 1. Seeing how arrays of objects store structured data and can be looped over with functions. Breaking code into small functions makes it easier to test, maintain, and understand the program.


2. What part was confusing or took longer to understand?
// 2. Understanding the frequency-counting logic in mostReadBook() took some effort.
